                    <p>When I began with ConversionPoint Technologies, we had several products that utilized very different design patterns, color schemes and styles. We needed to find a way to unify them and create a more efficient product building solution for our teams.</p>

                    <p>After meeting with department leaders, developers, and others, I began work to see how we could build a design system that unified our efforts from design to development.</p>

                    <p>One of my first efforts was creating an ecosystem map of how the current set of products flowed together, and how users interacted with them along the process.</p>

                <div class="project-copy">

                    <p>After interviewing current product users and company stakeholders to better understand the products and their value, I developed personas to help our team better empathize and keep in mind who we were designing for.</p>

                <div class="project-copy">

                    <p>Now that we had a good understanding of what we were working with and who would use it, I did an audit of our current product's components and capabilities. This allowed me to begin building a component library in Sketch. These new components would allow for better efficiency and accessibility, and less confusion when building updated or new product features.</p>

                    <p>I also used InVision's Design System Manager to allow developers the ability to view and gather information on each component from one area.</p>

                <div class="project-copy">

                    <p>While we knew our products were generally used on larger screens, I began work on a possible companion app that could be used to surface often used features and data. Small experiements like this allowed us to future scope while still concentrating on the core designs.</p>

                    <p>Next up, I began the initial construction of a front-end design system site that would be the single source of truth for designers, developers, stakeholders, etc. This website was built using the same components that made up GERTY.</p>

                    <p>Building a design system is an intense and at times overwhelming task. That said, nothing else in my design journey has allowed me to work so closely with different disciplines, interact with users, and stretch my understanding of what it truly means to be flexible in design.</p>
