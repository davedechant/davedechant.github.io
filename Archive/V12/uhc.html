                    <p>UnitedHealthcare (UHC) and their UX team are always moving forward with new and innovative products. To this point, Iâ€™d had the opportunity to work on a handful of projects, ranging from updates to existing products, to the redesign of their Provider home page.</p>

                    <p>Now, when you're a generalist/full-stack designer like myself, it means you have the ability to jump into projects that others might not be able to. In this instance, it meant taking a prototype that a fellow designer created in InVision, and making a front-end version.</p>
                    
                </div>

                <div class="project-img">

                    <img src="images/uhc-1.jpg">

                    <p class="description">Initial Eligibility/Claim Lookup screen built in HTML/CSS/JS</p>
                    
                </div>

                <div class="project-copy">

                    <p>While performing user testing at their in-house testing facility, the team realized that the InVision prototype wasn't giving them a realistic enough fidelity for users. Also, the dev team wasn't going to have anything ready for quite some time.</p>

                    <p>After a quick conversation with the lead designer, I was given the opportunity to jump in and code out a working HTML/CSS/JS version of the prototype. This meant quickly getting up to speed on the details and goals of this project.</p>

                    <p>After getting involved with the many weekly meetings and a few sessions with the designer, I was able to get a working version up and running in a few days on a Github account I had setup specifically for this project.</p>

                    <p>We began going over user scenarios with the on-site user testing team, and had the prototype updated to satisfy the conditions for a set of pre-determined user flows.</p>

                    <p>Next up was actually sitting in for the on-site user testing. We generally focused on four users per day over a two day session. Since I worked directly with the user testing team, I was able to make on the fly updates to the prototype between testing individual users.</p>

                    <p class="description">Eligibility &amp; Benefits screen built in HTML/CSS/JS. This&hellip; took a while.</p>
                    
                </div>

                <div class="project-copy">

                    <p>Throughout the process, I was also able to work directly with the dev team to provide guidance on the front-end of their build. We collaborated to make sure the design was one-to-one, and also to better define smaller design considerations like animation.</p>

                    <p>During this project, my family and I moved from Minneapolis to Seattle. That said, I maintained a working relationship with the UHC team, and continued to update the front-end prototype.</p>

                    <p>Through this front-end prototype and user testing, the team was able to gather insights and note improvements that were just not possible with the InVision prototype.</p>
