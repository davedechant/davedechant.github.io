                    <p>While Creative Director at ThinkSEM, we designed websites for all sorts of clients, with the common goal of lead generation as a priority.</p>

                    <p>One of the main issues we ran into were clients that needed a professional, responsive website that properly represented them, but were working with a budget that didn't allow for a custom build.</p>

                    <p>In my role, I was responsible for not only helping to design and build client sites, but also lead our day to day design services. I decided it was time we tackled the problem of missing out on low-budget clients. By creating a custom theme store, we would not only provide an option for these clients, but also add a new revenue generating service to our portfolio.</p>

                    <p class="description">The Themes Plus storefront that allows for theme preview, how it works, and features</p>
                    
                </div>

                <div class="project-copy">

                    <p>I began planning the features and service options by going back and looking over the commonalities between the types of websites we generally created. How could I build a set of websites that reused these design patterns, but retained a level of customizability that would allow for individuality?</p>

                    <p>While I was fairly comfortable with building custom WordPress themes, I'd have to step up my game to make sure these were easy to customize and build quickly. We needed to keep the cost down as much as possible, and that meant allowing for interchangeable components, easy color swaps, and flexible image areas.</p>

                <div class="project-copy">

                    <p>After a couple months of thinking through the logistics, service details, and finalizing the first few themes, I presented the idea to ThinkSEM's owner. He loved the idea, and we walked through how to best incorporate the service and what types of clients would be the best fit.</p>

                    <p>A short time later we had created a branded microsite that would be the home for our themes. We also had enough themes to begin piloting with specific clients. This was an exciting phase, as we were able to conduct user testing and identify areas to improve.</p>

                    <p class="description">Our themes share many components, but use typography, color, and layout to provide inividuality</p>
                    
                </div>

                <div class="project-copy">

                    <p>The theme store not only became a valuable service that generated additional revenue and padded our client portfolio, but also something that I'll always look back on with pride.</p>

                    <p>A lot of time and effort went into this project, and we came away with a better understanding of designing at scale, adopting new technologies, and working with clients to create something of value.</p>
