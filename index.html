                    <p><strong>My design journey began a long time ago I suppose.</strong></p>

                    <p>I've always liked solving problems, and certainly dislike the ones that remain unsolved. Sketching, interacting with computers, and the ideation opportunities they provide has certainly been and remains interesting to me.</p>

                    <p>After graduating with a degree in Graphic Design, I quickly learned that design had a much larger scope than I'd anticipated. Front-end coding was the primary addition to my skill set, but I love jumping into new software and dabbling in new skills when the opportunity arises.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I love bringing Design Thinking into most everything I work on. The ability to step back and really think about the problems we're trying to solve and make sure we're on the right path is incredibly valuable.</p>

                    <p>As for hobbies, and outside of experimenting in design, I'm always looking forward to my next adventure in video games, books, and film.</p>

                    <p>Here's looking forward to the journey that remains.</p>

                        <h3 class="project-overview-subtitle">Front-end Build &amp; User Testing</h3>

                        <p class="project-overview-tools"><strong>Tools/Methodologies Used:</strong> User Research (Qualitative), Sketch, InVision, HTML/CSS/JS, GitHub</p>

                        <p class="project-overview-intro">Along my design journey, user research and testing have proven invaluable to improving the overall experience.</p>

                        <p>UnitedHealthcare (UHC) and their UX team are always moving forward with new and innovative products. To this point, I’d had the opportunity to work on a handful of projects, ranging from updates to existing products, to the redesign of their Provider home page.</p>

                        <p>Now, when you're a generalist/full-stack designer like myself, it means you have the ability to jump into projects that others might not be able to. In this instance, it meant taking a prototype that a fellow designer created in InVision, and making a front-end version.</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="project-overview-image">

                        <img src="images/uhc-1.jpg">

                        <p class="project-overview-caption">Intro screen of prototype built in HTML/CSS/JS</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="project-overview-content">

                        <p>While performing user testing at their in-house testing facility, the team realized that the InVision prototype wasn't giving them a realistic enough fidelity for users. Also, the dev team wasn't going to have anything ready for quite some time.</p>

                        <p>After a quick conversation with the lead designer, I was given the opportunity to jump in and code out a working HTML/CSS/JS version of the prototype. This meant quickly getting up to speed on the details and goals of this project.</p>

                        <p>After getting involved with the many weekly meetings and a few sessions with the designer, I was able to get a working version up and running in a few days on a Github account I had setup specifically for this project.</p>

                        <p>We began going over user scenarios with the on-site user testing team, and had the prototype updated to satisfy the conditions for a set of pre-determined user flows.</p>

                        <p>Next up was actually sitting in for the on-site user testing. We generally focused on four users per day over a two day session. Since I worked directly with the user testing team, I was able to make on the fly updates to the prototype between testing individual users.</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="project-overview-image">

                    <div class="project-overview-content">

                        <p>Throughout the process, I was also able to work directly with the dev team to provide guidance on the front-end of their build. We collaborated to make sure the design was one-to-one, and also to better define smaller design considerations like animation.</p>

                        <p>During this project, my family and I moved from Minneapolis to Seattle. That said, I maintained a working relationship with the UHC team, and continued to update the front-end prototype.</p>

                        <p>Through this front-end prototype and user testing, the team was able to gather insights and note improvements that were just not possible with the InVision prototype.</p>

                        <p class="project-overview-intro">Ka is a wheel. Seemingly neverending, just like the works of Stephen King. How could I best navigate and find my next adventure in the King universe?</p>

                        <p>Stephen King has always been one of my favorite go-to authors. When I'm stuck looking for something to read, I generally gravitate towards his works. I'm especially fond of The Dark Tower series and the books that are connected to it.</p>

                        <p>Since I often find myself spending a lot of time figuring which of his myriad books to choose, I decided to create a prototype for an application that would help me with that task.</p>

                    <div class="project-overview-image">

                    <div class="project-overview-content">

                        <p>Since I was the primary user, it was pretty easy to research! I concentrated on an information architecture that would allow for easily scannable books and their categories. Then looked into ways to view and sort while making it easy to view info on individual works.</p>

                        <p>I did some sketches in my trusty sketch pad, and then dove into Figma to bring the prototype to life.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://stephenking.com/" target="_blank">Stephenking.com</a> was my primary data gathering tool, and came in extemely handy. I'm terribly tempted to build this out for personal use, but if nothing else was a great way to learn some new skills and really dive into an author I love.</p>

                        <p>Watch the video below to check out a quick demo of the prototype in action.</p>

                        <p class="project-overview-intro">I think we can all agree that on any journey, a good set of flexible, reusable tools will take you a long way.</p>

                        <p>When I began with ConversionPoint Technologies, we had several products that utilized very different design patterns, color schemes and styles. We needed to find a way to unify them and create a more efficient product building solution for our teams.</p>

                        <p>After meeting with department leaders, developers, and others, I began work to see how we could build a design system that unified our efforts from design to development.</p>

                        <p>One of my first efforts was creating an ecosystem map of how the current set of products flowed together, and how users interacted with them along the process.</p>

                        <p>After interviewing current product users and company stakeholders to better understand the products and their value, I developed personas to help our team better empathize and keep in mind who we were designing for.</p>

                        <p>Now that we had a good understanding of what we were working with and who would use it, I did an audit of our current product's components and capabilities. This allowed me to begin building a component library in Sketch. These new components would allow for better efficiency and accessibility, and less confusion when building updated or new product features.</p>

                        <p>I also used InVision's Design System Manager to allow developers the ability to view and gather information on each component from one area.</p>

                        <p class="project-overview-intro">Design Sprints are a great way to quickly validate ideas and move forward with confidence.</p>

                        <p>Specializing in retailer relationship management and demand and supply planning, SPS Commerce offers clients with many solutions. The problem was how to more easily allow purchase and implementation of those solutions.</p>

                        <p>Along with a few Slalom team members, we joined SPS Commerce in a six week engagement that began with a one week Design Sprint. Our Design Sprint included stakeholder interviews and Design Thinking workshops which helped us quickly ideate and align on problems and solutions to pursue.</p>

                        <p>The Design Sprint also allowed us to create crucial artifacts such as current journey maps, personas, storyboards, mind maps, and sketches. These artifacts helped to inform our approach on a future state service blueprint and prototypes.</p>

                        <p>Such was the need for this project. Securian Financial provides insurance, investment and retirement solutions. In doing so, they have a large Customer Service Agent (CSA) team that fields calls from inquiring customers asking all sorts of varying questions.</p>

                        <p>The CSA's utilized up to twelve systems per call when interacting with customers. Our task was to consolidate and streamline as many capabilities as possible into a Salesforce application called the ECC Desktop.</p>

                        <p>We also held auditing workshops with hand-picked CSA's and stakeholders that allowed us to better understand what needed to be shifted to the new experience, and what might be able to be left behind.</p>

                        <p>Working directly with the CSA's and stakeholders allowed the team to better empathize with their current day to day roadblocks, and come up with solutions that kept them at the forefront.</p>
