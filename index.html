                    <p><strong>My design journey began a long time ago I suppose.</strong></p>

                    <p>I've always liked solving problems, and certainly dislike the ones that remain unsolved. Sketching, interacting with computers, and the ideation opportunities they provide has certainly been and remains interesting to me.</p>

                    <p>After graduating with a degree in Graphic Design, I quickly learned that design had a much larger scope than I'd anticipated. Front-end coding was the primary addition to my skill set, but I love jumping into new software and dabbling in new skills when the opportunity arises.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I love bringing Design Thinking into most everything I work on. The ability to step back and really think about the problems we're trying to solve and make sure we're on the right path is incredibly valuable.</p>

                    <p>As for hobbies, and outside of experimenting in design, I'm always looking forward to my next adventure in video games, books, and film.</p>

                    <p>Here's looking forward to the journey that remains.</p>
